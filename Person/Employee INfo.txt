      Write a program, EmployeeTest.java, to calculate the gross pay for an employee,
        using Example 2-3 above, the Scanner class, and an object of the Employee class. 
        import java.util.Scanner;               // goes above class name 
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);  // goes at top of main ( ) method 
        Employee emp;
        1.  Input the first, middle and last names of an employee
            System.out.println("\nPlease enter the following information|\n");
            System.out.print ("Enter the first name: ");
            first = scan.next();
        2.  Input the payRate and hoursWorked
            System.out.print ("Enter the hourly rate of pay: ");
            payRate = scan.nextDouble();
        3.  Create an object of the Employee class
        4.  Calculate the grossPay of the employee, allowing for overtime
        5.  Display the employee's name, payRate, hoursWorked and grossPay
        6.  Place all this in a loop, asking the question "Another Employee?" at the end of the loop
            System.out.print ("\nGo Again? 1 - yes  2 - no: ");          
            goAgain = scan.nextInt();
			
    b)  Modify 4-a above, so that: 
        1.  Each Employee object goes into an array of such objects
            Employee []  emp = new Employee[20];
            // use count to keep track of each object in the array
            emp[count] = new Employee(first, middle, last, payRate, hoursWorked); 
        2.  Display the array of objects after entering is finished
            for(i=0; i < count; i++)
                System.out.println(emp[i]);
        3.  Sort the array of objects
            sort(emp,count);
        4.  Display the array of sorted objects	
		
    c)  Modify 4-b above, to create EmployeeTest2.java, 
        with input from a file, Employees.txt, using an editor such as Notepad:
        1.  Create an array of Employee objects and 2 Scanner objects: fileScan and recordScan
        2.  Enter information from an unsorted ASCII text file, Employees.txt, rather than the keyboard
        3.  List the unsorted array of employees.
        4.  Sort the array of objects, and list it.
        5.  Save the sorted array, with the gross pay, onto a hew file, SortedEmployees.txt
        6.  List the new file to see if the data was properly written using an editor such as Notepad.
