    /*Program Logic for Test Program

    1.  Enter a set of 15-20 names into a Binary Search Tree, tree1.
    2.  Recursively do an InOrder traversal of tree1 to see its contents.
    3.  Search for a word which is in the tree and give the results. 
    4.  Search for a word which is NOT in the tree and give the results.
    5.  Delete a word which is in the tree.
    6.  Recursively do an InOrder traversal of tree1 to show it is gone.
    7.  Try to delete a word which is NOT in the tree.
    8.  Use the copy constructor to create tree2 as a copy of tree1.
    9.  Recursively do an InOrder traversal of tree2 to verify its contents.
   10.  Make SURE that the output from this program is included at the end.
